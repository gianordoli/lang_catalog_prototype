The course is radically interdisciplinary utilizing approaches not only from contemporary and historical anthropology, but also from classics, psychoanalysis, biomedicine, critical medical studies, literature, history and film studies. Some of the questions addressed through the readings and the discussion are the following: How do we, as cultural subjects, perceive the body and what meanings do we assign to it? How do we decode these meanings by and through everyday and ritual practices? How are gender/power/knowledge inscribed on the body and how do we index them through the experience of the flesh (circumcision and kleitoridectomies, homoeroticism, drug use and addiction, torture, but also authorised and unauthorised erotics\"”pleasure, pain, play).

The Carthaginian writer, Tertullian, famously said that \"œChristians are made, not born.\" In this seminar, students read a selection of texts focused on questions that shaped the distinct identities of Christians in the Roman Empire. What is salvation? What is the relationship between believers and non-believers? And how does one become Christian? Further attention will be paid to the ways in which \"œChristian,\" \"œJewish,\" and \"œPagan\" identities shaped each other, as well as the complex relationship between Christians and Roman political authority. Finally, since \"œChristianity\" has served as in modern Western cultures as a paradigm for what is/is not \"œreligion,\" a close study of the identity formation of early Christians can provide basic insights into the modern concept of \"œreligion,\" and the resulting religious/secular divide.

Topics in this half will include neo-African religious musics in Cuba and Haiti, Spanish-derived songs from the Puerto Rican countryside, and creole musics like son, merengue, mento, and calypso. In the second half of the semester, we will turn our attention to the relationship between the Caribbean and the United States, focusing on the transnational flows of people and the mass media, the establishment of diaspora communities in the U.S., especially in New York, and the volatile foreign relations between the U.S. and vari ous Caribbean islands. Topics in this half will include the impact of Caribbean music on jazz, the ascendancy of salsa, and the global phenomena of reggae, soca, reggaeton, and bachata. Throughout this course, students will develop a knowledge of Caribbean musical styles and social issues, critical listening and reading skills and a basic vocabulary of musical concepts, and a deeper understanding of the essential role of music in the Caribbean and its transnational communities.

Ethnographically, this course will look at everyday life within and across the borders of reservations. Though the course will focus on the United States, we will also look at a number of other settler states to discuss how indigeneity is articulated as an international rights-based claim. Indigenous is a concept used to describe inherent notions of community, belonging, sovereignty, and political relatedness. Conversely, Indigenous, as well as analogues like Indian, Native, First Nation, and Aboriginal, have been used by states to define, detail, and survey colonized peoples as a tactic of governance. These categories are also used to displace, eliminate, and disperse populations struggling for political and cultural recognition. This course explores notions of indigeneity, as they are cast both within Indigenous communities, as well as the settler states that seek to regulate them.

In the early 1910s, Russian Cubo-Futurists staged a direct assault on the bourgeoisie with public interventions into everyday life. By 1915, advocating a self-sufficiency of artworks in all mediums, artists such as Kazimir Malevich and Vladimir Tatlin publicly unveiled some of the earliest and most theoretically articulate models of abstraction. The Bolshevik revolution of 1917 brought radical artists to the forefront of social and political transformations, empowering them to run state art institutions, create the first network of museums of living art, and make abstraction, albeit briefly, the language of revolution. By 1921, rejecting easel painting altogether, Constructivists analyzed the structural principles of invention, and some went to work on factories in order to directly affect the process of socialist production. We will examine, theoretically and historically, such key premises of the Russian avant-garde as faktura, the endpoint of painting, collective authorship, and the creation of an alternative public sphere. Never before has a group of radical artists been able to achieve such an immediate and vast impact on society and to affect the subsequent course of art history to such an extent.

We will look at architecture from outside the purview of architects - exploring the dynamic exchange between Minimalism, site-specificity and institutional space, advanced by Dan Graham and Michael Asher, while also considering more embodied architectural interventions by choreographers such as Trisha Brown and Sarah Michelson, and artist Andrea F raser. In addition to considering the parasitical relationship between architecture and culture, or what Hal Foster has called the \"œart-architecture complex\", we will consider the socio-political implications the built environment crystallizes. How does architecture reproduce social hierarchies? Learning from what Rem Koolhaas calls junkspace, what might be the relation between the remnants of Modernism and urban homogeneity?

Likewise, attention to the sexual politics of sound within aesthetics and performance might compel us to reframe sexual difference, and sexual dissidence. We will study how artists have deployed sound--as part of performances, videos, installations, and sculptures, as well as in \"sonic art\"--in ways that offer material for queer and feminist thought.

And a close examination of his art and his life can show us how one immensely fertile imagination grappled with all the crosscurrents of modern culture. From his early days in Barcelona's hardscrabble bohemia to his later, living-legend decades on the Riviera, Picasso felt the pulse of modernity. His work embraces political radicalism and erotic experimentation, ivory tower formalism and popular culture. Picasso was a man of paradoxes, and by exploring his contradictions we can gain unique insights into the challenges that any artist faces in the modern world. He was a traditionalist but also a nihilist, a man who remained true to his Spanish origins even as he passed much of his life in the cosmopolitan atmosphere of Paris. He painted some of the most delicately lyrical works of his century, but also, in Guernica, the ultimate political protest mural. His close engagement with Braque in the invention of Cubism may be the grandest collaborative effort in all the visual arts, but he was also the most solitary of creators, developing at the end of his life, in the prints of Suite 347, an unparalleled private erotic mythology. His friends and admirers included some of the essential authors of his time (both Gertrude Stein and Andre Malraux wrote books about his work), but he was also the first artist to be wholeheartedly embraced by a celebrity culture.

Strongly influenced by new environmentalist movements, environmental history emerged several decades ago as an effort to write the non-human world back into the making of human pasts.
