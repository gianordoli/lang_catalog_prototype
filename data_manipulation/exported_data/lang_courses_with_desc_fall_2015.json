Fueled by the Scientific Revolution (embodied by figures like Galileo, Bacon, Boyle and Descartes), philosophers from 17th and 18th century-Europe fervently rejected old authorities as they developed new answers to fundamental philosophical questions. These questions concerned the structure of reality, the capacities and limits of the human mind, the sources of legitimate knowledge, the shape and possibility of human freedom and the nature of morality. The objective of this course is for students to gain a broad understanding of the manner in which these questions were rethought in this period of radical change through a close reading of Descartes, Spinoza, Hobbes, Rousseau, Hume and Kant."]},{"title":"Rvolution & Pop Media in Hist","path_of_study":["Global Studies"],"subject_code_course_number":"LEDU 0910","description":[]},{"title":"Intro to Media Studies","path_of_study":["Religious Studies","Screen Studies","Literary Studies","Journalism + Design","The Arts","Culture & Media","Economics","Sociology","History","Psychology","Global Studies"],"subject_code_course_number":"LCST 2450","description":["*Introduction to Media Studies* [Track M] This course introduces the student to basic concepts and approaches in the critical analysis of communications media.

What is the role of digital media in political uprisings, specifically when it comes to the mobilization for oppositional politics in countries that censor and crush dissenting voices?

In 2009, for the first time in human history, more than half of the world's population resides in urban areas. Urban growth has outpaced the ability of governments to build essential infrastructures, and one in three urban dwellers lives in slums or informal settlements. The pace of urbanization results in built and social environments that place stress on human immune systems, increase exposures to industrial toxins, and present sanitation challenges.  In addition, the effects of climate change have led to concerns about renewed incidence of infectious diseases that disproportionally affect urban populations.  We will study how these factors collectively affect a city's health, as well as how these cities can respond to meet the increased challenges."]},{"title":"Intermediate Playwriting","path_of_study":["Global Studies","Culture & Media","Politics"],"subject_code_course_number":"LLSW 3540","description":[]},{"title":"NYC: Psych City of Immigrants","path_of_study":["Global Studies"],"subject_code_course_number":"LNGC 1731","description":[]},{"title":"Psychology of Personality","path_of_study":["Global Studies"],"subject_code_course_number":"LPSY 4550","description":[]},{"title":"Dance & Theories of Community","path_of_study":["Psychology"],"subject_code_course_number":"LAIC 3302","description":[]},{"title":"How to Read a Play","path_of_study":["Liberal Arts","Literary Studies"],"subject_code_course_number":"LNGC 1479","description":[]},{"title":"Cooper:Ch231 Org Chem I Disc","path_of_study":["Psychology","Literary Studies"],"subject_code_course_number":"LSTS 3203","description":[]},{"title":"Cooper: Architecture","path_of_study":["The Arts","Culture & Media"],"subject_code_course_number":"LNGC 3025","description":[]},{"title":"Mapping it Out","path_of_study":["Culture & Media"],"subject_code_course_number":"LARS 3055","description":[]},{"title":"Culture Concept","path_of_study":["Politics","Culture & Media","Urban Studies","Global Studies","Anthropology","Journalism + Design"],"subject_code_course_number":"LCST 3211","description":["*Culture Concept* [Track C] While culture has become a buzzword in the social sciences, the category of culture is not unproblematic, either as an object of analysis or as a framework of explanation.

What do people mean when they say \"The Sixties\"? When did the decade begin and when did it end? What were its roots? What is its legacy? How do we begin to understand a period which was characterized by upheaval and fragmentation and challenge to many of the most sacred dogmas of American life? Far more than a movement for civil rights, or a war, or a cultural phenomenon, the sixties was a period of rapid political and social change. A decade that bore witness to the highs and lows of the American experience, the 1960s has to be understood both as a watershed and as an ongoing process. The history of this long decade emphasizes the interrelationships between the specific events of the period and constant pressure of diverse political movements. Many of the major issues we are grappling with today -- the American presence in Afghanistan, conflict over immigration, school re-segregation, and cultural anxieties over gay marriage -- emerge from the successes, failures, and excesses of the 1960s. This seminar will look at the 1960s through multiple prisms: the Civil Rights movement, Black power, the war in Viet Nam and antiwar agitation, the assassinations, the student movements, feminism, and popular culture. We will use a wide range of sources -- a mixture of primary documents (including film footage) and secondary accounts, but the emphasis will be on the words and the actions of the participants.

Brainstorming, research and other design strategies will be used to imagine new ways of reporting and expressing the news. In addition to growing expectations for depth of reporting, increased emphasis will be on creative presentation of work, and telling stories visually as well as through writing. Students will develop a deeper understanding of the role systems thinking plays in reporting their stories, expressing their stories, and inserting their stories into the media ecosystem. The class is project-based and collaborative, with the project to be determined based on needs-based assessment, student interest and skills brought in from other classes. Students will continue focusing on engagement and impact, and be encouraged to experiment. Work will be published through the New School Free Press and/or social media. A designer, a social media editor and a data reporter are embedded in the class. Other experts will be brought in based on student need. This class will have a mentor.

Changes in technology and the growing access to large amounts of data have allowed journalists to develop new and effective ways of engaging readers with hard-to-fathom information. In an age of information overload, sometimes the best way to explain data is visually. This is a major component of reimagining journalistic storytelling in the digital age. Knowing when and how to represent data visually is now an integral part of the discipline. Students will learn basic visualization design and evaluation principles, as well as learn how to acquire, parse and analyze data sets. This class will expose students to the basic ideas of expressing data visually. Students will do one final project as a class."]},{"title":"Beyond The Beats: NY Poets","path_of_study":["Contemporary Music"],"subject_code_course_number":"LNGC 1405","description":["The generation of writers and artists to emerge in the wake of the Beat Generation in New York City is usually referred to as the New York School. The New York school is most often associated with well known and celebrated figures such as poets Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery, Bernadette Mayer, Alice Notley and Tedd Berrigan. But what do these writers have in common beyond sharing the geography of New York City in their formative years? This course will examine the construction of the New York School as a literary category in the mid twentieth century and explore its ongoing impact on contemporary writing in New York. In addition to reading the writings of several New York School poets and listening and viewing visual and acoustic works by some of the artists and musicians with whom they collaborated, students will explore first-hand how some of New York's downtown neighborhoods shaped the work in question. As one of the required assignments, students will have the option of submitting a piece of creative writing."]},{"title":"Intro to Art History","path_of_study":["Sociology","Global Studies"],"subject_code_course_number":"LARS 2215","description":[]},{"title":"Housing Policy","path_of_study":["Global Studies","Sociology","Interdisciplinary Science"],"subject_code_course_number":"LURB 4514","description":[]},{"title":"IS:Teaching & Learning","path_of_study":["Global Studies","The Arts"],"subject_code_course_number":"LNGC 3952","description":[]},{"title":"Environmental Policy & Law","path_of_study":["Global Studies","Anthropology","Literary Studies"],"subject_code_course_number":"LPOL 3051","description":[]},{"title":"Happiness: Theory & Practice","path_of_study":["Anthropology","Literary Studies","Global Studies"],"subject_code_course_number":"LWEL 2140","description":[]},{"title":"Mediation: Resolution Strategy","path_of_study":["Psychology"],"subject_code_course_number":"LPSY 4509","description":[]},{"title":"Genres of Cultural Analysis","path_of_study":["Literary Studies"],"subject_code_course_number":"LCST 3522","description":[]},{"title":"Political Economy/Development","path_of_study":["Literary Studies"],"subject_code_course_number":"LPOL 4040","description":[]},{"title":"Cooper: CE 351 Urban Trans","path_of_study":["Literary Studies"],"subject_code_course_number":"LSTS 2055","description":[]},{"title":"Media Ethics","path_of_study":["Psychology"],"subject_code_course_number":"LCST 3456","description":[]},{"title":"Cooper:Bio101 Mol & Cell Bio","path_of_study":["Psychology"],"subject_code_course_number":"LSTS 2120","description":[]},{"title":"Rise & Fall of Colonialism","path_of_study":["Psychology","Sociology","Politics","Culture & Media"],"subject_code_course_number":"LHIS 2001","description":[]},{"title":"HealthClass 2.0 Practicum","path_of_study":["Psychology","Politics","Sociology","Culture & Media","The Arts","Literary Studies","Philosophy"],"subject_code_course_number":"LNGC 3961","description":["This field-based practicum provides support for students involved as leaders of HealthClass2.0, an experiential fitness and food education program operating in NYC schools.

The course, within the context of anthropology, has two considerations, a historical one and a contemporary one. If anthropology can be construed as the study of human society and culture, then, following Marcel Mauss, this study must consider the actual, physical bodies that constitute the social and the cultural. Therefore great attention needs to be paid to the historical, theological, religious, political and juridical forces that have participated in this process. The course is radically interdisciplinary utilizing approaches not only from contemporary and historical anthropology, but also from classics, psychoanalysis, biomedicine, critical medical studies, literature, history and film studies. Some of the questions addressed through the readings and the discussion are the following: How do we, as cultural subjects, perceive the body and what meanings do we assign to it? How do we decode these meanings by and through everyday and ritual practices? How are gender/power/knowledge inscribed on the body and how do we index them through the experience of the flesh (circumcision and kleitoridectomies, homoeroticism, drug use and addiction, torture, but also authorised and unauthorised erotics\"”pleasure, pain, play). What are the negotiations of bodily identities in illness, disease and death (cancer, AIDS, pregnancy, paraplegia), and what are the constructions on the ownership of the body (the individual, the community, the church, the state, the legal system). This course explores these ideological and political discourses that have made not only the constructions on the body possible but have also provided the reading of those discourses. This course satisfies requirements in Reading, and Doing.\n\nThis course counts toward the Gender Studies minor."]},{"title":"Witness & Intervention: Media","path_of_study":["Liberal Arts","The

We will examine how different thinkers have considered the meaning and significance of warfare, its relationship to politics, and its wide-ranging effects on warring societies. The course will begin from the connection early modern theorists have established between warfare and state formation and move to study the different justifications of interstate conflict within the Westphalian system, with attention to the distinctions between imperial and colonial wars. The course will then focus on the changing practices in warfare in the contemporary period, engaging with the question of a post-Westphalian paradigm of violent conflict. Recent transformations in military organization and technology, the involvement of state and nonstate actors, different conceptions of the enemy, doctrines of conflict as well as attendant modalities of security, spatiality, and visuality are among themes to be studied.

We then look to twentieth-century writers of the greater English-speaking world, for whom the settled novelistic formulas had grown stale, and consider whether they have succeeded in merely putting the genre on life support or in reviving the form for a new era.

However, as Orin Starn writes, \"œThe truth is that indigeneity, precisely because it has no fixed or necessary meaning or destination, comes with no guarantees.\" This has been revealed by instances of armed resistance to both the FBI and tribal government at Wounded Knee in the early 1970's, as well as the forms of protest and political action that continue to demand justice and recognition for Indigenous peoples today. Ethnographically, this course will look at everyday life within and across the borders of reservations. Though the course will focus on the United States, we will also look at a number of other settler states to discuss how indigeneity is articulated as an international rights-based claim. Indigenous is a concept used to describe inherent notions of community, belonging, sovereignty, and political relatedness. Conversely, Indigenous, as well as analogues like Indian, Native, First Nation, and Aboriginal, have been used by states to define, detail, and survey colonized peoples as a tactic of governance. These categories are also used to displace, eliminate, and disperse populations struggling for political and cultural recognition. This course explores notions of indigeneity, as they are cast both within Indigenous communities, as well as the settler states that seek to regulate them. Course readings will include introductions to Indigenous politics and settler colonial studies, complemented by a range of ethnographic texts that account for the forms of power that operate between settler governance and Indigenous political life."]},{"title":"Hispanic Cult through Film","path_of_study":["The Arts","Anthropology","Religious Studies","Politics"],"subject_code_course_number":"LLSL 3023","description":[]},{"title":"Cooper:Ch110 Gen Chemistry","path_of_study":["Politics","Religious Studies","Anthropology","The Arts","Culture & Media"],"subject_code_course_number":"LSTS 2012","description":[]},{"title":"Latin American Modernisms","path_of_study":["Religious Studies","The Arts","Politics","Anthropology"],"subject_code_course_number":"LVIS 2017","description":[]},{"title":"Zone Infrastructure","path_of_study":["Politics","Global Studies","Liberal Arts"],"subject_code_course_number":"LHIS 4537","description":["A new form of global space is emerging\"”\"œthe Zone\".

Evolving theories of corporeality provide a lens to consider performance practice across disciplines, including emerging fields of interdisciplinary performance and body art. From this historical background, the course examines contemporary trends in Tanztheater (Pina Bausch, Sasha Walz, etc.) and Physical Theater (Theatre du Complicite, SITI Company, etc.), and the eroding boundaries between contemporary performance forms. Students will gain an understanding of concepts of presence and theories of the body in performance, and explore the work of several 20th century practitioners through reading and viewing assignments, and in the completion of a series of research and writing projects over the course of the semester."]},{"title":"Delicious Movement","path_of_study":["The Arts","Theater"],"subject_code_course_number":"LINA 3045","description":[]},{"title":"Educative Violence & Politics","path_of_study":["Global Studies","Culture & Media","Literary Studies","Journalism + Design","Screen Studies"],"subject_code_course_number":"LEDU 3037","description":[]},{"title":"Visual Storytelling","path_of_study":["Culture & Media","Literary Studies","Journalism + Design","Screen Studies","Global Studies"],"subject_code_course_number":"LLSJ 3003","description":["A unique opportunity for mature students, this workshop offers an introduction to the discipline of reporting and telling stories visually.

In the early 1910s, Russian Cubo-Futurists staged a direct assault on the bourgeoisie with public interventions into everyday life. By 1915, advocating a self-sufficiency of artworks in all mediums, artists such as Kazimir Malevich and Vladimir Tatlin publicly unveiled some of the earliest and most theoretically articulate models of abstraction. The Bolshevik revolution of 1917 brought radical artists to the forefront of social and political transformations, empowering them to run state art institutions, create the first network of museums of living art, and make abstraction, albeit briefly, the language of revolution. By 1921, rejecting easel painting altogether, Constructivists analyzed the structural principles of invention, and some went to work on factories in order to directly affect the process of socialist production. We will examine, theoretically and historically, such key premises of the Russian avant-garde as faktura, the endpoint of painting, collective authorship, and the creation of an alternative public sphere. Never before has a group of radical artists been able to achieve such an immediate and vast impact on society and to affect the subsequent course of art history to such an extent. Nor has any other artistic legacy been so quickly wiped out from the public sphere, like in the Stalinist Soviet Union of the mid-1930s, only to find a powerful resonance in the West during subsequent decades."]},{"title":"Architecture without Architect","path_of_study":["Philosophy","Culture & Media","The Arts"],"subject_code_course_number":"LVIS 3021","description":["This course will explore historical, sociopolitical, and formal facets of architecture as they intersect with disciplines of art history and visual studies, performance, and dance since the early 20th century.

Sites of inquiry will range from the 1930s International Style movement and its lubrication of more recent developments of global architecture and the \"œBilbao Effect\". We will look at architecture from outside the purview of architects - exploring the dynamic exchange between Minimalism, site-specificity and institutional space, advanced by Dan Graham and Michael Asher, while also considering more embodied architectural interventions by choreographers such as Trisha Brown and Sarah Michelson, and artist Andrea F raser. In addition to considering the parasitical relationship between architecture and culture, or what Hal Foster has called the \"œart-architecture complex\", we will consider the socio-political implications the built environment crystallizes. How does architecture reproduce social hierarchies? Learning from what Rem Koolhaas calls junkspace, what might be the relation between the remnants of Modernism and urban homogeneity? Students will be introduced to a range of readings including architectural theory, artist's writings, as well as art history and criticism. Together we will explore a number of sites in which the concept of architecture and the built environment is reframed or rethought by both architects as well as artists, performers and scholars."]},{"title":"Movie Love:Cinephilia,Casablan","path_of_study":["Literary Studies","Theater","The Arts"],"subject_code_course_number":"LCST 3474","description":[]},{"title":"Women of Color Feminism","path_of_study":["The Arts","Literary Studies","Theater"],"subject_code_course_number":"LNGC 1535","description":["We will begin this course with Audre Lorde's two foundational essays \"œThe Uses of Anger\" and \"œThe Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power,\" to shape how we understand activist and intellectual \"œtechnologies.\" Framing technology as the practical application of knowledge, we will consider how Women of Color Feminist thought and activism has invented and mobilized a wide range of technologies to produce a huge body of work toward social change.

Likewise, attention to the sexual politics of sound within aesthetics and performance might compel us to reframe sexual difference, and sexual dissidence. We will study how artists have deployed sound--as part of performances, videos, installations, and sculptures, as well as in \"sonic art\"--in ways that offer material for queer and feminist thought. The role of musical, vocal, and auditory practices within political movements will also be considered. Course material will span artwork and popular culture as well as black studies, Marxist feminism, film theory, queer studies, psychoanalysis, visual studies, and art history. Reciprocally, we will explore how close attention to sound and sound studies might reshape central knots in feminist theory and queer theory. In addition to reading and listening assignments, students will complete a series of writing projects over the course of the semester. This course counts toward the Gender Studies minor."]},{"title":"DJ Skills Practice Session","path_of_study":["Screen Studies","Urban Studies","The Arts","Liberal Arts","Global Studies","Contemporary Music","Economics"],"subject_code_course_number":"LMUS 2026","description":["Required practice session for all students enrolled in LMUS 2020: DJ Skills & Styles.","Required practice session for all students enrolled in LMUS 2020: DJ Skills & Styles."]},{"title":"Masculinity and Popular Music","path_of_study":["Journalism + Design","Politics","The Arts","Contemporary Music","Culture & Media"],"subject_code_course_number":"LMUS 3102","description":["Music has long been bound up with the construction and interrogation of gender.

And a close examination of his art and his life can show us how one immensely fertile imagination grappled with all the crosscurrents of modern culture. From his early days in Barcelona's hardscrabble bohemia to his later, living-legend decades on the Riviera, Picasso felt the pulse of modernity. His work embraces political radicalism and erotic experimentation, ivory tower formalism and popular culture. Picasso was a man of paradoxes, and by exploring his contradictions we can gain unique insights into the challenges that any artist faces in the modern world. He was a traditionalist but also a nihilist, a man who remained true to his Spanish origins even as he passed much of his life in the cosmopolitan atmosphere of Paris. He painted some of the most delicately lyrical works of his century, but also, in Guernica, the ultimate political protest mural. His close engagement with Braque in the invention of Cubism may be the grandest collaborative effort in all the visual arts, but he was also the most solitary of creators, developing at the end of his life, in the prints of Suite 347, an unparalleled private erotic mythology. His friends and admirers included some of the essential authors of his time (both Gertrude Stein and Andre Malraux wrote books about his work), but he was also the first artist to be wholeheartedly embraced by a celebrity culture. In class we will examine a series of images and texts that are central to the understanding of Picasso--ranging from his early studies of circus performers, to his surrealist mythologies, to the aesthetic views reflected in his writings. At the same time, students will work individually on various aspects of his life and experience--from his political activism and possible anarchist sympathies, to his involvement with the performing arts, to the Surrealist photography of his lover Dora Maar, to his appearances in photojournalism and the movies. We will also visit museums and print collections in order to gain a closer understanding of his technical innovations in painting, printmaking, sculpture, and collage."]},{"title":"The Music and Drama of Opera","path_of_study":["Contemporary Music"],"subject_code_course_number":"LMUS 3011","description":["Opera was invented around 1600 not as an essentially musical form but as a recreation of Greek drama, understood to be a synthesis of poetry, theater, dance, song, and instrumental music.

We conclude with examples of cutting-edge multi-media work, including attending the premiere of Stefania de Kenessey's \"Bonfire of the Vanities.\" For the final project, students complete an independent research project on a composer, period, or related non-Western genre, or compose a 10-minute \"opera\" (individually or in collaboration with other students) on a topic of their choice.

Democratic aspirations, demands for equality, human rights, autonomy and social justice are proclaimed by various movements and activist groups in different parts of the world. The major historical political shifts of the last two centuries and emergence of national states are related to the advancement of democracy. However, the question remains salient - what is democracy? This course focuses on the concept and notions of democracy. It introduces students to selected debates in democratic theory and concepts which are situated at the heart of democracy such as freedom, equality, collectivity, autonomy, emancipation, self-rule, law, popular sovereignty and power. We will critically examine various theories and views of democracy from classical thinkers of ancient Greece to contemporary thinkers of radical democracy. The course places attention to critiques of democratic politics and paradoxes and tensions inherent within the democracy itself such as democracy's tyrannical and imperial tendencies, relationship between popular sovereignty and individual rights, self-rule and logic of representation, tensions between liberalism and democracy, deliberation and agonism, elitist versus participatory democracy. We will explore major themes related to debates between ancient and modern models of democracy, tensions between formal, institutional democratic politics and theories of radical democracy and examine if advancing communication technologies of capitalist societies foster or diminish social democratic potential."]},{"title":"Surveillance & Spectacle","path_of_study":["Urban Studies","The Arts"],"subject_code_course_number":"LPOL 3028","description":[]},{"title":"Guy Debord","path_of_study":["The Arts","Global Studies","Culture & Media"],"subject_code_course_number":"LCST 4080","description":[]},{"title":"Philosophy and the Media","path_of_study":["Global Studies","The Arts","Culture & Media"],"subject_code_course_number":"LPHI 3016","description":[]},{"title":"Building Bridges","path_of_study":["Global Studies"],"subject_code_course_number":"LFYW 1900","description":[]},{"title":"Theories of Social Interaction","path_of_study":["Global Studies"],"subject_code_course_number":"LSOC 3049","description":[]},{"title":"Tech, Inequality & Econ Growth","path_of_study":["Economics"],"subject_code_course_number":"LECO 2125","description":["We will review notions of economic growth as they pertain to issues of wealth and income inequality as well as technology.

These days, the influence of environmental transformation on human experience seems plainly obvious. But until quite recently, historians and other social scientists tended to narrate the histories of global societies and cultures as the outcomes of human action alone. Strongly influenced by new environmentalist movements, environmental history emerged several decades ago as an effort to write the non-human world back into the making of human pasts. Though approaches vary, environmental history encompasses a wide array of projects concerning the effects (both intended and unintended) of human societies on the environment, the role of non-human nature in the making of human history, and the history of ideas about humans and the environment.\nWe will begin by reading some classic texts that showcase the diversity of approaches to writing environmental history. The remainder of the course will cover major themes in the environmental history of global capitalist modernity. Topics will include: the many natures of pre-capitalist empire states, colonial capitalism and agrarian development, imperialism and the production of environmental knowledge, the making of global commodity frontiers, disease and the environment, energy regimes and the rise of petro-politics, the city as environment, global food production, and the politics of climate change.
