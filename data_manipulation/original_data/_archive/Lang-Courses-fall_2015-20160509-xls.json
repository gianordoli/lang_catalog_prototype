The psychology community has now had a hundred years of psychoanalytic dream interpretation. In this course students learn to apply psychoanalytic techniques to interpret dreams in order to know the unconscious. Students explore psychoanalytic theory, dreams, the unconscious, and hermeneutics (the philosophy of the interpretation of texts). They also explore cultural aspects of interpretation through the example of African-American traditions about dreams in Anthony Shafton's Dream-Singers: The African American Way with Dreams. This course satisfies some of the requirements in Literary Studies: in both concentrations. This course satisfies some of the requirements in Literary Studies: Writing AND Literature concentration "

Since media are at once technology, art and entertainment, and business enterprises, they need to be studied from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. The readings for the course reflect this multi-pronged approach and draw attention to the work of key thinkers and theorists in the field. Moreover, the readings build awareness of the international dimensions of media activity, range, and power. [Track M]"

Fueled by the Scientific Revolution (embodied by figures like Galileo, Bacon, Boyle and Descartes), philosophers from 17th and 18th century-Europe fervently rejected old authorities as they developed new answers to fundamental philosophical questions. These questions concerned the structure of reality, the capacities and limits of the human mind, the sources of legitimate knowledge, the shape and possibility of human freedom and the nature of morality. The objective of this course is for students to gain a broad understanding of the manner in which these questions were rethought in this period of radical change through a close reading of Descartes, Spinoza, Hobbes, Rousseau, Hume and Kant."

The course focuses on common practice tonality but also explores other possibilities for organizing musical sound; inspired by John Cage's experimental music courses at The New School, it offers problems and solutions in the field of composition and encourages inventiveness. The seminar+ course format includes concert attendance outside of regular classtime. This is a required course for Lang Contemporary Music majors/minors and a recommended prerequisite for LMUS 2003: Composition and Analysis."

Rather than engaging primarily in interpretation, these courses illuminate the formal properties of a genre as defined by its practitioners: the bricks, mortar, and architecture of writing. The goal of this inquiry is to enrich our writing, therefore these insights are put into practice through short creative assignments. Since aesthetic and social philosophies often play a role in the development of literary styles, students will master the ideas that informed the works under consideration.

In order to deepen understanding of the relationship between authorial intention and reader response, they will also read work by established authors (as well as one another) and offer written and oral analyses that detail the mechanics of literary technique, as well at locate these readings in a larger literary-historical context. In our reading of canonical as well as contemporary authors (Montaigne, Virginia Woolf, George Orwell, W.G. Sebald, John Jeremiah Sullivan), we will parse the literary process from inspiration through execution. The goal here is to refine our perceptual ability as readers so we can employ this heightened awareness as writers.

Students will research (via the library, as well direct observation) and develop selected topics into reflective essays. In order to deepen understanding of the relationship between authorial intention and reader response, they will also read work by established authors (as well as one another) and offer written and oral analyses that detail the mechanics of literary technique, as well at locate these readings in a larger literary-historical context. In our reading of canonical as well as contemporary authors (Montaigne, Virginia Woolf, George Orwell, W.G. Sebald, John Jeremiah Sullivan), we will parse the literary process from inspiration through execution. The goal here is to refine our perceptual ability as readers so we can employ this heightened awareness as writers. This discussion\"\u201dfocusing on mastering a subject and discovering the appropriate narrative form and style\"\u201dwill inform each student's essay writing project. It is also intended to provide the student with a methodology for textual interpretation and analysis that will be necessary and applicable in their study of all the liberal arts.

Students explore the Bible's methods of characterization and elliptical storytelling techniques.  Biblical concepts \"\u201cmonotheism, human failure and redemption, creation\"\u201c are grounded by scholarship in ancient near eastern history and also examined from contemporary perspectives: the prophet Jeremiah in light of 9/11 and other familiar destructions; and Mother Eve and biblical daughters through feminist and gender analysis.

We will follow three intertwining story-lines through the history of \"religion\" and its study in the west: religious apologetics, critiques of religion (epistemological, historical, ethical), and Europe's encounters and entanglements with the rest of the world, especially during the heyday of colonialism. A critical understanding of \"religion\" and its implication in modern and postmodern understandings of politics, ethics, gender and progress can make this Eurocentric concept a vehicle for profound critique and an opening to genuine dialogue."

We will analyze how this affects our perceptions of and attitudes towards individuals (including ourselves) and groups. We will examine why people conform, how they influence each other, why they firmly hold on to stereotypes and why they engage in pro- or antisocial behaviors. By analyzing these phenomena we will see how theories of human behavior can be tested rigorously via laboratory experiments and field studies"

The emphasis of the program is to help students with the broader intellectual, creative, and critical thinking that goes into their writing as well as general work as students. In addition, all Academic Fellows meet once a week in a seminar to study the theory and practice that goes into this kind of mentoring. \n(Note: Academic Fellows must be nominated by an instructor; following the nomination there is a short interview process with the Academic Fellows instructor. The course is by permission only. Most Academic Fellows are nominated in the previous academic year, but there are usually spaces for late nominations)."

In particular, it presents culture as a dynamic arena of social struggle and utopian possibility. Students read key thinkers and examine critical frameworks from a historical and a theoretical approach, such as Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall and the Birmingham School; the work on popular culture, identity politics, and postmodernism in America; and the emergence of a 'global cultural studies' in which transnational cultural flows are examined and assessed.

We will begin by considering what constitutes a personal culture, and follow this up by examining the works of certain music, dance and movie critics, and writing our own reviews and personal pieces.  From this descriptive/evaluating work, we will move into close observation of our surroundings and the social networks we've embraced (the human kind), reconstructing such surroundings, using dialogue and observed detail.  The weight and meaning of personal cultural in extreme circumstances will be looked at.  At the end of the course, students will choose topics for longer papers that will discuss and frame the observing, describing and evoking they've been practicing.  A final paper could be a memoir piece focusing on the \"œforces\"\u009d that shaped a personality; or on an event in the past that means something to you (and why); or it could be a longer reportorial piece (about a television series, some linked literary texts, several song cycles or record albums, a fashion designer, an artist, an interesting chef or restaurant, etc.).  These papers can be approached from either a subjective point of view of an objective one. Throughout the semester, emphasis will be placed on tone, style, prose rhythms, beginnings and endings, and the search for, and enhancement of, each student's own writing voice.  Course authors will include Carl Wilson, assorted music, dance and movie critics, Mikhail Zoshchenko, Marina Tsvetayeva, James Baldwin, possibly Primo Levi, Viktor Skhlovsky or Laurent Binet, and others."

This course attempts to address a variety of questions about the functioning of modern economic systems, such as: What causes recessions and depressions? Why is inflation rate higher in some countries than in others? What types of economic policies can be implemented, and what outcomes can be expected? The topics to be discussed in this course include: Interaction between goods, labor and financial markets; and the relationship between unemployment and inflation. The main goal of this course will be to improve your economic literacy and ability to apply economic models to analyze world events. This is a ULS course, taught through Lang.

It focuses on an age-old question: how to navigate between the worlds of art and commerce? The title refers to a 1964 article by the legendary Canadian pianist Glenn Gould, one of the few musicians at that time to think about music in relationship to technological changes as they affected culture. This course explores the creative life and commercial forces in today's culture, and the role of media companies and modern technology in limiting or enhancing the abilities of creative artists to envision their careers and to reach their audiences. Admission to the course is limited on the basis of a written essay. Contact Evan Rapport, Music Program Coordinator, for details."

In 2009, for the first time in human history, more than half of the world's population resides in urban areas. Urban growth has outpaced the ability of governments to build essential infrastructures, and one in three urban dwellers lives in slums or informal settlements. The pace of urbanization results in built and social environments that place stress on human immune systems, increase exposures to industrial toxins, and present sanitation challenges.  In addition, the effects of climate change have led to concerns about renewed incidence of infectious diseases that disproportionally affect urban populations.  We will study how these factors collectively affect a city's health, as well as how these cities can respond to meet the increased challenges."

This course examines a selection of texts that have interesting things to say about what it means to live in a complicated body. We will explore the tendency to use disabled bodies as a form of metaphor, and well as the critique of this tendency. First, we will pay particular attention to the relationship between the representation of injured or disabled bodies and gender and race. Then, we will explore the ways that texts about disability confound our expectations about the differences between literary and visual representations of non-normative bodies. Literary texts may include Flannery O'Connor, A Good Man is Hard to Find, Junot Diaz, Drown, Toni Morrison \"œRecitatif,\"\u009d Stephen Crane, \"œThe Monster,\"\u009d David Small, Stitches, and Kevin Brockmeier, The Illumination: A Novel. Films may include Dark Victory (1939) directed by Edmund Goulding Safe (1994) directed by Todd Haynes, Freaks (1932) directed by Todd Browning, and Blue (1993) directed by Derek Jarman. Will we also read criticism by Susan Sontag, Leonard Davis, and Elaine Scarry, among others."

Through close visual analysis of diverse objects in tandem with a range of readings (drawn from literature and literary criticism; social theory and gender studies; postcolonial and global studies, to name a few), students will gain insight into how one builds an interpretation, stressing the centrality of skills of critical thinking and reading as objects are brought into dialogue with texts.

Feminist theory has argued that these images are not those of \"real women,\" but has had less to say about how \"she\" has become a structural necessity for marketing. This course examines both these aspects\"\u201dgender and commodity. It examines popular culture (Beyonce) and theories of gender, but also writers and artists who have dissented from this figure, from Kathy Acker to Beatriz Preciado. It also considers men who have appropriated and channeled her, from Warhol's transgender superstars to Almodovar's Hollywood drag. This course links theories of the commodity, gender, and sexuality and applies them to contemporary everyday experience.  [Tracks M & C]"

The course, within the context of anthropology, has two considerations, a historical one and a contemporary one. If anthropology can be construed as the study of human society and culture, then, following Marcel Mauss, this study must consider the actual, physical bodies that constitute the social and the cultural. Therefore great attention needs to be paid to the historical, theological, religious, political and juridical forces that have participated in this process. The course is radically interdisciplinary utilizing approaches not only from contemporary and historical anthropology, but also from classics, psychoanalysis, biomedicine, critical medical studies, literature, history and film studies. Some of the questions addressed through the readings and the discussion are the following: How do we, as cultural subjects, perceive the body and what meanings do we assign to it? How do we decode these meanings by and through everyday and ritual practices? How are gender/power/knowledge inscribed on the body and how do we index them through the experience of the flesh (circumcision and kleitoridectomies, homoeroticism, drug use and addiction, torture, but also authorised and unauthorised erotics\"\u201dpleasure, pain, play). What are the negotiations of bodily identities in illness, disease and death (cancer, AIDS, pregnancy, paraplegia), and what are the constructions on the ownership of the body (the individual, the community, the church, the state, the legal system). This course explores these ideological and political discourses that have made not only the constructions on the body possible but have also provided the reading of those discourses. This course satisfies requirements in Reading, and Doing.\n\nThis course counts toward the Gender Studies minor."

Vera Brittain introduces her autobiography with the assertion that the outbreak of war in 1914 came as an annoying interruption of her everyday life, cannily underscoring the terrible ironies of private lives enacted in a world shaken by political cataclysm and profound socio-economic ruptures.This course takes the juxtaposition of ordinary life and the major events of the twentieth century as its subject. Using a variety of first-person accounts, it explores: the century's catastrophic world wars, the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, changes in gender roles and expectations, the transformation of rural life, and the challenges of immigration and ethnicity in late twentieth-century Europe. We address the ways that memoirs and other types of first-person accounts work as historical documents and explore the complicated politics of memory."

Through class discussions and some lecturing, this course provides an introduction to the Constitution's major doctrines and explores how and why this document has remained vital and active while other Constitutions have failed. After examining the drafting and ratification of the Constitution in the late 1780s, the course uses a close reading of significant Supreme Court decisions to examine the Constitution's major doctrines and the Supreme Court's interpretation of those doctrines.  Among other topics, the course will cover the allocation of power among the three branches of federal government, the role of the federal judiciary, federalism, the power of Congress to regulate, due process, and individual rights."

How might the objects around us shape the world we live in? How might material cultural analysis shape our understandings of place and scale?

We will examine how different thinkers have considered the meaning and significance of warfare, its relationship to politics, and its wide-ranging effects on warring societies. The course will begin from the connection early modern theorists have established between warfare and state formation and move to study the different justifications of interstate conflict within the Westphalian system, with attention to the distinctions between imperial and colonial wars. The course will then focus on the changing practices in warfare in the contemporary period, engaging with the question of a post-Westphalian paradigm of violent conflict. Recent transformations in military organization and technology, the involvement of state and nonstate actors, different conceptions of the enemy, doctrines of conflict as well as attendant modalities of security, spatiality, and visuality are among themes to be studied. Theorists include Machiavelli, Hobbes, Kant, Hegel, Clausewitz, Schmitt, Deleuze and Guattari, Foucault, and Butler.\n"

This course uses the city's history as a laboratory to investigate the development of the rights and privileges that we now think of as \"œcitizenship.\"\u009d The readings explore who had access to rights, who was denied them, and who struggled to obtain them over the course of almost four centuries. Topics covered include slavery and emancipation, immigration and naturalization, law enforcement and criminal justice, suffrage and the electoral process, social welfare and income inequality, and protest and the right to public space. The course demonstrates that citizenship did not suddenly emerge on the national level, but slowly accrued over time in response to local circumstances."

These transformations had catastrophic consequences for indigenous peoples and relied upon the labor of twelve million enslaved Africans. While our focus will be on the British empire, this course draws parallels between Spanish, English and French endeavors overseas, in order to evaluate how the mass migration of Europeans and the forced exodus of Africans to the \"œnew world\"\u009d laid the groundwork for American society as we know it today. Our approach towards history will be thematic. Rather than memorizing dates and events, the assignments will ask you to consider how people who possessed competing interests, values and beliefs interacted with each other.

Digitization of conventional archives, easily ported to our desktops, make historians responsible for managing rich archives that are largely hidden on hard drives and cloud servers. Avoiding technology is impossible; learning to use it to our advantage is critical to becoming a well-trained researcher and writer. Social media offers new opportunities and challenges for colleagueship, collaboration, and teaching. Most importantly, digital platforms, data mining, and mapping allow us to ask and answer big historical questions, tell new stories and speak to larger and more diverse audiences. \n\nAs a field within the digital humanities, digital history represents a new phase in the modern history of the book, the history of reading and the history of the archive. In this course, we will learn about the digital tools that can advance our work as historians, and the new opportunities digital media offers: online collecting and archiving, telling stories through data mining and design; the ethics of online research and publication of primary documents; collaboration with multiple authors; open access publishing and navigating copyright in digital media environments."

Within scholarship on Europe and the United States, the first major works in this field emerged to challenge a dominant tendency to narrate history as the story of humans and humans alone. Many of the pioneers of environmental history were also heavily engaged with the new politics of environmentalism. Among scholars of the postcolonial world, the rise of environmental history has been much more recent, and the creative new studies that have appeared lately contribute to a rather different history of thinking about the relationship between humans and their environments. This reading-intensive course will provide us with an opportunity to enjoy some of the fantastic new scholarship on the environmental history of the Middle East and South Asia that has been published in the past decade or so. Organized thematically, the class aims to offer a sampling of the different kinds of questions that historians working under the broad banner of environmental history have been asking. But we will also dabble in some older traditions of writing about human societies and their environments\"\u201dfrom varieties of environmental determinism to development studies to the rich tradition of agrarian social history\"\u201din order to think together about what is or is not different about an environmental history approach."

    "CourseDescription" : "What were the nineteensixties? What do people mean when they say \"The Sixties\"? When did the decade begin and when did it end? What were its roots? What is its legacy? How do we begin to understand a period which was characterized by upheaval and fragmentation and challenge to many of the most sacred dogmas of American life? Far more than a movement for civil rights, or a war, or a cultural phenomenon, the sixties was a period of rapid political and social change. A decade that bore witness to the highs and lows of the American experience, the 1960s has to be understood both as a watershed and as an ongoing process. The history of this long decade emphasizes the interrelationships between the specific events of the period and constant pressure of diverse political movements. Many of the major issues we are grappling with today -- the American presence in Afghanistan, conflict over immigration, school re-segregation, and cultural anxieties over gay marriage -- emerge from the successes, failures, and excesses of the 1960s. This seminar will look at the 1960s through multiple prisms: the Civil Rights movement, Black power, the war in Viet Nam and antiwar agitation, the assassinations, the student movements, feminism, and popular culture. We will use a wide range of sources -- a mixture of primary documents (including film footage) and secondary accounts, but the emphasis will be on the words and the actions of the participants. "

Once derided as an \"incentive to seduction,\" the novel achieved critical acclaim as well as cultural prominence in the mid-nineteenth century; it remains by far the most popular form of printed literature to this day. Starting from the picaresque novel of the eighteenth century, we see how the English novel reached its characteristic mode in the 1800s, with Austen's domestic drama and Dickens's sentimental realism. We then look to twentieth-century writers of the greater English-speaking world, for whom the settled novelistic formulas had grown stale, and consider whether they have succeeded in merely putting the genre on life support or in reviving the form for a new era. Readings include: Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice; Charles Dickens, Great Expectations; Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway; Salman Rushdie, Shame; and Edward P. Jones, The Known World."

Yet, most people believe with high confidence that their subjective experience of the world is objective fact, which exacerbates issues surrounding social cognition (e.g., interpersonal relationships).  This course is not designed to study these cognitive mechanisms historically, or neurologically, but is specifically tailored to look at how these cognitive mechanisms affect perception of reality and all that follows from that.  To this end, the course will survey research findings concerning false perceptions/memories (and levels of confidence in them), emotional influences on cognitive processes, stereotyping, social cognition, and interpersonal relationships. Lastly, we will discuss why evolutionary pressures may have led to the selection of cognitive mechanisms that allow for such imperfections."

He was writing on the verge of suicide caught in the midst of a painful spiritual crisis. This struggle resulted not only in the completion of this lasting masterpiece, but also in a decisive change of its author's outlook on life and art and his rebirth as radical thinker and artistic reformer. Working closely with both the definitive version in updated translations and making way through selected drafts the course will trace the evolution of both the work and its author placing them in their appropriate historical and cultural contexts. Knowledge of Russian Is not required and neither is specialty knowledge of Tolstoy. But those taking the course should be prepared to do dedicated work with the novel's text and critical literature in translation and qualified to do so (please speak with the instructor if you have questions). In its \"afterlives\" capacity, the course will deal with copyright, parody and self-parody, and with the theory and practice of imitation as it will look at several attempts to rewrite, adapt and redo this masterwork in fiction and other artistic genres (theater, cinema, ballet) under differing political and ideological regimes. You are encouraged to read the novel prior to taking the course in the translation of Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky."

We will examine some of the key concepts and debates that are central to the anthropology of postcolonial Africa with an aim to developing a critical perspective on representations of this vast continent and the diversity of practices that make Africa more than a continent.

One of Germany's greatest contribution to culture, this complex bipartite drama (1808; 1832) was neither the first nor the last, in Goethe's homeland and elsewhere, to reflect with the help of the Faustian legend on the shifting models of comprehension underlying the conditions and results, the means and ends, the losses and gains of human striving.\n\nThis course critically examines the progression of the idea of striving in pursuit of  progress and immortality through the ages observing not only the transformation of the figure of Faust through the centuries in different literary genres and works of art, but also exploring such key concepts as the conditions and the price of the pact as the corollary of extraordinary ambition, the mastery of knowledge and of the order of life's encounters with  persons, things and historical circumstance, and the reconvening  of the mythical Eros with human sensuality.\n\nThe course will concentrate on philosophical, narrative, performative, political and representational elements accompanying the reappearance of Dr. Faustus in a variety of genres (literary, theatrical, cinematic, musical, and those in visual art) across the widely changing historical and ideological landscape, from the study of the versions of the medieval Faust legends and moving onwards to Christopher Marlowe, Goethe, Thomas Mann, David Mamet and other authors.   Special attention will be paid to the versions of Faust and its variations in Soviet Russia, the Nazi Germany and after the fall of communism.\"\n\n\n"

In this course, we will investigate key ideas around which political belonging (and not belonging) have been conceptualized including: humanity, citizenship, statelessness, alienage, and migrant status.  We will also reflect on how identities and laws associated with these ideas relate to the possibility of political action.  A particular focus of the course will be on the politics of citizenship and political belonging as played out in the context of migration and border control. We will investigate examples that relate to refugees, undocumented migrants and transnational labor migrants, amongst others. We will examine the transformation of political belonging with respect to globalization and neoliberalism, and consider the implications of struggles to belong for enduring and radical expressions of citizenship."

In this course students explore the historical, political, economic, and cultural inflections of this phrase. Beginning with the definitions of \"dream\" and \"spectacle\" from thinkers such as Freud, Nietzsche, and Debord, students then move to the proto-Hollywood of Hollyrood, Scotland, where the popular \"panorama\" industry was concentrated in the 19th century. They trace the notion of an industrialized form of collective dreaming from the Arcades of Paris, through to the wide-angle lens of Los Angeles, including not only Hollywood, but also Disneyland. Movies about movies, thematizing the notion of a dream factory, make up a significant portion of the course as do critical readings of the ways in which \"the people\" are both created and seduced by the interface of the screen (Nathaniel West, Adorno, Mattelart, etc.). Students gain sophisticated sense of the cultural and political stakes embodied in company names such as Dreamworks, as well as ways to begin dreaming up alternative dreams--or even techniques of awakening --to those provided by the movie industry.

We'll discuss how the frames of reporting differ between mainstream media and citizen media sites like Global Voices Online. What are some obstacles for contentious collective actions, mobilized through social media? What is the role of digital media in political uprisings, specifically when it comes to the mobilization for oppositional politics in countries that censor and crush dissenting voices?

Further attention will be paid to the ways in which \"œChristian,\"\u009d \"œJewish,\"\u009d and \"œPagan\"\u009d identities shaped each other, as well as the complex relationship between Christians and Roman political authority.

In the second half of the semester, we will turn our attention to the relationship between the Caribbean and the United States, focusing on the transnational flows of people and the mass media, the establishment of diaspora communities in the U.S., especially in New York, and the volatile foreign relations between the U.S. and vari ous Caribbean islands. Topics in this half will include the impact of Caribbean music on jazz, the ascendancy of salsa, and the global phenomena of reggae, soca, reggaeton, and bachata. Throughout this course, students will develop a knowledge of Caribbean musical styles and social issues, critical listening and reading skills and a basic vocabulary of musical concepts, and a deeper understanding of the essential role of music in the Caribbean and its transnational communities.

    "CourseDescription" : "Charlie Chaplin appeared for the last time as the iconic figure of the \"˜Little Tramp' in his brilliant comic masterpiece and last silent film \"˜Modern Times'. \"˜The Tramp' or the underdog fighting for the poor and the destitute against the indifferent oppression of an industrialized society is arguably the most recognizable fictional character in film history.  Impacted by America's Great Depression and the consequences of global industrialization, Chaplin in 1936 wrote, directed, choreographed, produced and played the leading role in \"˜Modern Times'. No one before or since has had complete control over such a sensational international hit. In the film, Chaplin explored important themes of economic and social human rights, the rise of the labor movement and his own theories of how to redress social injustice. Using Chaplin's seminal work as a springboard, this course will trace the emergence of the \"˜activist artist' by delving into distinct movements for social change -- from the reformers at the turn of the 20th century; to the social documentarians during the Great Depression; to artists today who are working to expand global awareness of human rights issues. We will also explore the shifting nature of the artist, from those who document and satirize in order to raise consciousness, to artists who also seek to create genuine social transformation."

A primary focus is to help students find a connection to the floor from which they can stretch and move out into space. Attention is given to educating the body to move with specificity; to sharpening each student's rhythmic, spatial and energetic acuities; and to augmenting each student's range of qualitative possibilities. The course, which utilizes movement practices that are being utilized by some of the field's most progressive choreographers, will give students experience learning choreographed sequences, while also fostering students' ability to self-direct as movers. Prerequisite: a previous Moving with Somatics or Contemporary Dance Practices course, or permission of instructor or dance program director is required. Space is limited and priority is given to dance concentrators.  Note: This course is offered for variable credit: First year dance concentrators and others taking this course for the first time, and who do not meet the pre-requisite, should register for 2 credits/MWF classes; students who meet the pre-requisite should register for 1 credit/MW classes only."

With in-depth analyses of popular music from around the world, we will question the role of technology in a diverse array of musical practices, locations, and time periods in order to better understand how technology impacts musical meaning. We will begin by looking at early sound reproduction technologies such as the phonograph and radio and the discourses of musical and cultural change that these technologies afforded. We then move to more current examples in which music, technology, place, and identity overlap in revealing ways. Course themes will include intersections of local and global influences, cultural imperialism, strategies of resistance, generational change, digital technology, fidelity and loss as technological and cultural ideas, ethnographic inquiry, intellectual property, and World Music 2.0. Case studies will include Indonesian indie pop, Southeast Asian heavy metal, noise, Bollywood, Iranian pop, Bhangra, cassette sermons, piracy, and the mp3 as a cultural artifact, among others. Through weekly reading and writing assignments, short papers, and a research paper, students will complete the course with a nuanced understanding of the relationship between music, technology, and culture."

However, as Orin Starn writes, \"œThe truth is that indigeneity, precisely because it has no fixed or necessary meaning or destination, comes with no guarantees.\"\u009d This has been revealed by instances of armed resistance to both the FBI and tribal government at Wounded Knee in the early 1970's, as well as the forms of protest and political action that continue to demand justice and recognition for Indigenous peoples today. Ethnographically, this course will look at everyday life within and across the borders of reservations. Though the course will focus on the United States, we will also look at a number of other settler states to discuss how indigeneity is articulated as an international rights-based claim. Indigenous is a concept used to describe inherent notions of community, belonging, sovereignty, and political relatedness. Conversely, Indigenous, as well as analogues like Indian, Native, First Nation, and Aboriginal, have been used by states to define, detail, and survey colonized peoples as a tactic of governance. These categories are also used to displace, eliminate, and disperse populations struggling for political and cultural recognition. This course explores notions of indigeneity, as they are cast both within Indigenous communities, as well as the settler states that seek to regulate them. Course readings will include introductions to Indigenous politics and settler colonial studies, complemented by a range of ethnographic texts that account for the forms of power that operate between settler governance and Indigenous political life."

    "CourseDescription" : "As urban unrest accelerated alongside domestic public policy change, civil rights, and economic transformation, American artists began developing a movement in the 1960s and 70s now known as Land Art. This turning towards geology and nature, though not without a certain social conservatism and escapism, also provided women and artists of color spaces of critique through the planning and construction of outdoor memorials, mounds, and living fields. This class situates Land Art within contemporary narratives of post-war art history in order to consider how \"land,\" \"place,\" and \"site\" have become part of art's literal and metaphorical \"expanded field.\" The work of artists Beverly Buchanan, Michelle Stuart, Nancy Holt, Agnes Denes, and Ana Mendieta will be paired with close readings of texts by Lucy Lippard, Robert Smithson, Miwon Kwon, Jane Jacobs, and legal theorist Cheryl Harris in order to look at the tensions inherent in the expanding of such fields. Students will draft their own instructional documents or \"scores\" for producing an earthwork, thereby putting some of Land Art's tensions into play. This course also fulfills a studio or practice-based visual arts course requirement for Visual Studies students. This course counts toward the Gender Studies minor."

A number of important engineering structures such as beams (with different support conditions), trusses, and frames will be analyzed to compute the static loads in each part of the structure. Next, we will look at dynamics and motion of objects under external excitements. We will look at the kinetics of rigid body motion in different coordinate systems, and solve a variety of applied problems. If time permits, we will look briefly at the theory of vibration. The focus of the course will be on understanding the basic concepts and problem-solving."

In addition to reading the writings of several New York School poets and listening and viewing visual and acoustic works by some of the artists and musicians with whom they collaborated, students will explore first-hand how some of New York's downtown neighborhoods shaped the work in question.

We also consider American coverage of peoples abroad, typically in war-based settings, as we extend our political and social discussions both geographically and conceptually. Throughout we ask, how have photographers reinforced or contested prevailing views of racial identity through the photographic form? And how are viewers influenced by these portrayals of race?

What kind of knowledge is transmitted in this teaching and learning and what are the consequences of the different ways in which Voguing is taught? We will look at the roots of Vogue in performance forms dating from the slave era and the social shifts that occurred during the Harlem Renaissance. We will also examine the relationship between a dance practice and the social world.

Evolving theories of corporeality provide a lens to consider performance practice across disciplines, including emerging fields of interdisciplinary performance and body art. From this historical background, the course examines contemporary trends in Tanztheater (Pina Bausch, Sasha Walz, etc.) and Physical Theater (Theatre du Complicite, SITI Company, etc.), and the eroding boundaries between contemporary performance forms. Students will gain an understanding of concepts of presence and theories of the body in performance, and explore the work of several 20th century practitioners through reading and viewing assignments, and in the completion of a series of research and writing projects over the course of the semester."

In the early 1910s, Russian Cubo-Futurists staged a direct assault on the bourgeoisie with public interventions into everyday life. By 1915, advocating a self-sufficiency of artworks in all mediums, artists such as Kazimir Malevich and Vladimir Tatlin publicly unveiled some of the earliest and most theoretically articulate models of abstraction. The Bolshevik revolution of 1917 brought radical artists to the forefront of social and political transformations, empowering them to run state art institutions, create the first network of museums of living art, and make abstraction, albeit briefly, the language of revolution. By 1921, rejecting easel painting altogether, Constructivists analyzed the structural principles of invention, and some went to work on factories in order to directly affect the process of socialist production. We will examine, theoretically and historically, such key premises of the Russian avant-garde as faktura, the endpoint of painting, collective authorship, and the creation of an alternative public sphere. Never before has a group of radical artists been able to achieve such an immediate and vast impact on society and to affect the subsequent course of art history to such an extent. Nor has any other artistic legacy been so quickly wiped out from the public sphere, like in the Stalinist Soviet Union of the mid-1930s, only to find a powerful resonance in the West during subsequent decades."

    "CourseDescription" : "This course will explore historical, sociopolitical, and formal facets of architecture as they intersect with disciplines of art history and visual studies, performance, and dance since the early 20th century. We will investigate specific moments in architectural history and criticism as a way of considering the built environment as a reflection and container of visual and material culture. Sites of inquiry will range from the 1930s International Style movement and its lubrication of more recent developments of global architecture and the \"œBilbao Effect\"\u009d. We will look at architecture from outside the purview of architects - exploring the dynamic exchange between Minimalism, site-specificity and institutional space, advanced by Dan Graham and Michael Asher, while also considering more embodied architectural interventions by choreographers such as Trisha Brown and Sarah Michelson, and artist Andrea F raser. In addition to considering the parasitical relationship between architecture and culture, or what Hal Foster has called the \"œart-architecture complex\"\u009d, we will consider the socio-political implications the built environment crystallizes. How does architecture reproduce social hierarchies? Learning from what Rem Koolhaas calls junkspace, what might be the relation between the remnants of Modernism and urban homogeneity? Students will be introduced to a range of readings including architectural theory, artist's writings, as well as art history and criticism. Together we will explore a number of sites in which the concept of architecture and the built environment is reframed or rethought by both architects as well as artists, performers and scholars."

Sexual politics have been understood almost exclusively in terms of visual and textual markers, yet their entanglement with the sensory and philosophical register of sound is extensive. Gender and sexuality cut through discourses on sound and sonic aesthetics, asking us to rethink both the history of sonic art and the status of sound in the arts more broadly. Likewise, attention to the sexual politics of sound within aesthetics and performance might compel us to reframe sexual difference, and sexual dissidence. We will study how artists have deployed sound--as part of performances, videos, installations, and sculptures, as well as in \"sonic art\"--in ways that offer material for queer and feminist thought. The role of musical, vocal, and auditory practices within political movements will also be considered. Course material will span artwork and popular culture as well as black studies, Marxist feminism, film theory, queer studies, psychoanalysis, visual studies, and art history. Reciprocally, we will explore how close attention to sound and sound studies might reshape central knots in feminist theory and queer theory. In addition to reading and listening assignments, students will complete a series of writing projects over the course of the semester. This course counts toward the Gender Studies minor."

And a close examination of his art and his life can show us how one immensely fertile imagination grappled with all the crosscurrents of modern culture. From his early days in Barcelona's hardscrabble bohemia to his later, living-legend decades on the Riviera, Picasso felt the pulse of modernity. His work embraces political radicalism and erotic experimentation, ivory tower formalism and popular culture. Picasso was a man of paradoxes, and by exploring his contradictions we can gain unique insights into the challenges that any artist faces in the modern world. He was a traditionalist but also a nihilist, a man who remained true to his Spanish origins even as he passed much of his life in the cosmopolitan atmosphere of Paris. He painted some of the most delicately lyrical works of his century, but also, in Guernica, the ultimate political protest mural. His close engagement with Braque in the invention of Cubism may be the grandest collaborative effort in all the visual arts, but he was also the most solitary of creators, developing at the end of his life, in the prints of Suite 347, an unparalleled private erotic mythology. His friends and admirers included some of the essential authors of his time (both Gertrude Stein and Andre Malraux wrote books about his work), but he was also the first artist to be wholeheartedly embraced by a celebrity culture. In class we will examine a series of images and texts that are central to the understanding of Picasso--ranging from his early studies of circus performers, to his surrealist mythologies, to the aesthetic views reflected in his writings. At the same time, students will work individually on various aspects of his life and experience--from his political activism and possible anarchist sympathies, to his involvement with the performing arts, to the Surrealist photography of his lover Dora Maar, to his appearances in photojournalism and the movies. We will also visit museums and print collections in order to gain a closer understanding of his technical innovations in painting, printmaking, sculpture, and collage."

In Western capitalist societies formal democratic institutions enjoy the status of a \"common sense\" and are taken by many for granted. Democratic aspirations, demands for equality, human rights, autonomy and social justice are proclaimed by various movements and activist groups in different parts of the world. The major historical political shifts of the last two centuries and emergence of national states are related to the advancement of democracy. However, the question remains salient - what is democracy? This course focuses on the concept and notions of democracy. It introduces students to selected debates in democratic theory and concepts which are situated at the heart of democracy such as freedom, equality, collectivity, autonomy, emancipation, self-rule, law, popular sovereignty and power. We will critically examine various theories and views of democracy from classical thinkers of ancient Greece to contemporary thinkers of radical democracy. The course places attention to critiques of democratic politics and paradoxes and tensions inherent within the democracy itself such as democracy's tyrannical and imperial tendencies, relationship between popular sovereignty and individual rights, self-rule and logic of representation, tensions between liberalism and democracy, deliberation and agonism, elitist versus participatory democracy. We will explore major themes related to debates between ancient and modern models of democracy, tensions between formal, institutional democratic politics and theories of radical democracy and examine if advancing communication technologies of capitalist societies foster or diminish social democratic potential."

This course provides an in-depth understanding of the American adversarial trial system through an analysis of trial practice and evidentiary rules.  Following a historical examination of the constitutional, social and political role of the trial in American, the course will focus on courtroom procedures, rules of evidence, witness preparation and examination, the art of advocacy, the role of narrative as persuasion, and the importance of strategic analysis in trial preparation.\n\nThis course provides more than a theoretical foundation.  Students will learn how to prepare and conduct opening arguments, direct examinations, cross examinations, introduce evidence, and closing arguments. The course will use a simulated trial based on the official hypothetical case published by the American Mock Trial Association for 2015-2016, which is a criminal case.  As we study various components of a trial, students will use the hypothetical case to prepare their own simulations which will be videoed and reviewed with the Professor.  At the end of the semester students will prepare and conduct a trial of the American Mock Trial Association Hypothetical case.\n\n\nThe course is open to any student interested in learning more about the courts and the legal process but is required for any student who hopes to compete with the Lang intercollegiate mock trial team.\n"

In this course we examine the ways in which social difference intersects with ideas of nature and ecological sustainability in often persistent and troubling ways. We will look at social, political and economic processes through which disempowered communities, in particular racial minority communities and the urban poor, are disproportionally exposed to environmental hazards, are denied access to resources, and are excluded from decision-making processes regarding the production of landscapes. Examples of the outcome of such processes include Hurricane Katrina, inner city food deserts, and the displacement of indigenous peoples from their land. An exploration of historical and contemporary case studies including toxic waste, food, air pollution, climate change, labor and transportation, will help us in understanding environmental inequality, its causes, and what is being done about it on local, national and global levels. \n"

Today, while witch-persecution continues in certain parts of the world, the figure of the witch is both exploited and championed in films, television, music videos, visual art, and fashion. Whether on American Horror Story: Coven, Game of Thrones, Maleficent, or Salem, the witch transgresses hegemonic boundaries by rejecting religious, cultural, or patriarchal ideologies.

Almost a decade earlier, Billie Holiday's 'Strange Fruit' became what British music critic Leonard Feather would call 'the first significant protest in words and music, the first unmuted cry against racism.' From the Futurists to Bob Dylan to Pink to N.W.A., from classical to jazz to folk, rock and punk, politically engaged music can be found in almost every genre and generation. This course explores forms of political discourse in twentieth-century and current music, focusing not only of the politics of governance, but also on how music plays a role in the politics of race, gender, religion, and national identity. Students are encouraged to explore their own musical backgrounds and interests when completing individual research projects about a specific genre, piece or political movement of their choice."

Drawing on various strands of philosophy engaged in discourses commonly referred to as \"œnew materialism\"\u009d and \"œposthumanism\"\u009d and inspired by such thinkers as Rosi Braidotti, Karen Barad, Jane Bennett, Diana Coole, and Donna Haraway, we will ask whether humans and nonhumans can ever be clearly differentiated despite our habits of thought that presuppose their fundamental differences from each other."

This course will put such disparities into a greater economic context.  It will focus on understanding key characteristics of modern capitalist economies including issues of distribution, class, economic growth and crisis. This course requires students to think abstractly with the use of simple economic models and to be able to critically discuss the topics we cover."

Yet clinical archives, literature, and other artifacts of culture show how people have grappled with the bodily, moral, and psychological effects of loss and catastrophe long before they became matters of medical science. This course explores a variety of ways in which trauma and its aftermath have been defined throughout history as well as the cultural contexts that have shaped strategies of recognition, reflection, and healing. Our readings will include first-hand accounts of trauma survivors and narratives of collective trauma as well as clinical literature that frames trauma as an object of scientific knowledge and medical practice. \n"

Through these questions we will investigate how the arts are implicated in specific regimes and economies of time and how they can contribute to forms of disruption and resistance."

    "CourseDescription" : "This course explores embodied presence in performance through a study of historical threads and contemporary practices in both dance and theater. We will look at performance structures that consider the real presence of the performer beyond created expressions of character in theater or movement strategies in dance, from early 20th century ideas of physicality in theater and the birth and growth of German Expressionist dance through postwar intersections of dance and theater in Europe and America. Evolving theories of corporeality provide a lens to consider performance practice across disciplines, including emerging fields of interdisciplinary performance and body art. From this historical background, the course examines contemporary trends in Tanztheater (Pina Bausch, Sasha Walz, etc.) and Physical Theater (Theatre du Complicite, SITI Company, etc.), and the eroding boundaries between contemporary performance forms. Students will gain an understanding of concepts of presence and theories of the body in performance, and explore the work of several 20th century practitioners through reading and viewing assignments, and in the completion of a series of research and writing projects over the course of the semester."

These media elements can present alternate realities, bridge the gap between performer and audience, trigger memories of history and the past, and reconfigure our relationships to time, space, and the body. Students will analyze works of influential theatrical artists, directors, and designers alongside concepts from media theory to understand how these elements function on stage and in performance and how they contribute to ongoing conversations about the role of technology in theater and everyday life. This course fulfills the media and performance requirement for Lang Theater majors and minors."

As Warren Hoffman argues, \"the history of the American musical is the history of white identity in the United States.\" This course will spin off from Hoffman's claim to explore what happens when we analyze musical theater through the lens of race, considering not only shows explicitly \"about race\" (South Pacific, The King and I, Dreamgirls, Ragtime, for example). How does race manifest in a show like The Bridges of Madison County or Next To Normal? How does casting play a role in larger ensemble shows? What about the people who aren't on stage: the writers, directors, and choreographers? We will study older musicals like Showboat and Oklahoma! but also more contemporary shows like A Chorus Line and Passing Strange. We will read key texts in critical race theory to think through these issues in relation to American musicals of the past and present too."

    "CourseDescription" : "90 years after its abolition, the Califate has been revived a year ago in Iraq by an unknown Al-Qaeda contender with no formal religious credentials. The ISIS leader's calls on all Muslims to accept his authority can be interpreted as the latest manifestation of a \"crisis of authority\" within Islam. While this notion of a crisis has been used time and over, it has also been criticized for its Eurocentric underpinnings (\"Islam needs its own Reformation\") or its oversimplifications (\"a battle between fundamentalists and reformists\"). This graduate course, mixing lectures and seminar discussions, wants to assess how notions of authority and political power have been diachronically conceived and debated within Muslim majority societies and how we can make sense of current developments such as the spread of the group \"Islamic State\". Through a selection of texts written by Muslim intellectuals (J. Al-Afghani, S. Qutb, A. Shariati, T. Ramadan) we will: discuss some of the most important debates on legitimacy and political authority within Islam; assess the challenges of \"modernity\" for Muslim-majority society at the turn of the 19-20th centuries; and analyze the re-arrangements generated by the creation of independent states in the 20th century and their possible collapse nowadays. Sociological theories on forms of authority, civility, autonomy, secularism, and social movements will provide a second strand of readings, aimed at offering analytical insights on ongoing social and political developments."

    "CourseDescription" : "Hardly a day goes by without news of the many ways in which climate change is reshaping societies around the world. These days, the influence of environmental transformation on human experience seems plainly obvious. But until quite recently, historians and other social scientists tended to narrate the histories of global societies and cultures as the outcomes of human action alone. Strongly influenced by new environmentalist movements, environmental history emerged several decades ago as an effort to write the non-human world back into the making of human pasts. Though approaches vary, environmental history encompasses a wide array of projects concerning the effects (both intended and unintended) of human societies on the environment, the role of non-human nature in the making of human history, and the history of ideas about humans and the environment.\nWe will begin by reading some classic texts that showcase the diversity of approaches to writing environmental history. The remainder of the course will cover major themes in the environmental history of global capitalist modernity. Topics will include: the many natures of pre-capitalist empire states, colonial capitalism and agrarian development, imperialism and the production of environmental knowledge, the making of global commodity frontiers, disease and the environment, energy regimes and the rise of petro-politics, the city as environment, global food production, and the politics of climate change. Environmental history is an inherently inter-disciplinary field, and students from all majors and departments are welcome. Course counts towards credit in the Capitalism Studies Minor.\n\n\n"

This includes exploring the role of cultural and developmental factors in how individuals perceive choice and make decisions. In the third module, we examine decisions in the context of intergroup relations; concepts such as race, power and poverty that draw on discussions of previous modules will be explored here.
